## @tnantoka

The name `tnantoka` is pronounced as `tiː næntoʊkə`.  
`Nantoka` in Japanese means the same as the regular expression `/.+/`, which matches any character sequence.   
My first and last names both start with `t`, so they match the regular expression `/t.+/`.  
That's why I chose my name.
